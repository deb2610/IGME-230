# Game Master Mayhem

## High Concept
GM Mayhem is a classic platformer with heavy influences form RPGs and table top games.

## Genre
GM Mayhem is an Action/Adventure 2D platformer with plenty of monsters for you to hack'n'slash.

## Platform
Web for desktop.

## Story
Oh no! You plans for you latest installment of Caverns & Critters has gone missing! You must traverse this fantasy inspired world to find the pages of your game guide. Defeat the zany creatures of the world you designed in order to get back the peices of your tabletop game!

## Aesthetics
### Art
16-bit art that is cartoonish. its meant to be exagerated and dramatic. There will be art assets for the character, GUI, enemies, background, and collectables.
### Audio
Looped chipsound era style with common fantasy and cinematic melodies and cord progression. There will be audio assets for the character, enemies, overwolrd, and UI.


## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player must defeat enemies and gather parts of thier game guild in time for their session on Cavern & Critters.
The game will work on a World system. there will be an amount of worlds that has yet to be determined. Each world will then have a number of levels. The levels will have pages strewn about of a few types: tips, story, and monster. A Tip page will give an insightful GM tip. A Story page will have narrative hooks that a GM could use. Finally, the Monster page will have ideas for enemies for you game. The monster page will activly spawn monsters into the level that the player must defeat to get the page.
I want to include a Meta aspect to the game so that when a page of the guide is collected it offers actual tips and information for running a tabletop rpg.

### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"
I see the player learning from the monologues and babbleings of the protagonist. The navigation will and key bindings will be displayed on the GUI and pause screen.

### Player Learning
The player must be familier with hack'n'slash tactics and platform navigations(aka jumping). There is room tactically planning your jumps to avoid enemy fire and attacks. it would be smart of the player to defeat the enemies and get the Monster page first so that it isn't constantly spawning monsters anymore.
